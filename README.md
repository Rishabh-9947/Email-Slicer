# Email-Slicer
The Email Slicer is a simple Python script that takes an email address as input and extracts the username and domain name. This project is an excellent way to learn string manipulation in Python. It demonstrates how to use the split method to divide a string into parts and how to handle user input. The Email Slicer can be a useful tool for anyone who needs to quickly separate the components of an email address for validation, analysis, or any other purpose.
